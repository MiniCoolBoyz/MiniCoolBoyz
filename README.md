<em>I automate what others do manually — then I make it faster.</em>

## Now

- Building a platform that monitors **100+ e-commerce sources** in real-time — instant alerts, zero downtime
- Designing **multi-agent AI workflows** — teams of autonomous agents that analyze, execute, and report
- Turning every repetitive problem I find into infrastructure that runs itself

## What I Work On

| Area | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Real-Time Monitoring** | Multi-store tracking with sub-second detection and instant Discord alerts |
| **AI Agent Orchestration** | Parallel agent teams that do in minutes what takes hours manually |
| **Production Infrastructure** | Deploy pipelines, process management, self-healing systems |
| **Full-Stack** | Async Python backends, Next.js dashboards, browser automation |
